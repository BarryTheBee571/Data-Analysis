    "The purpose of this program is to provide the marketing team with valuable insights into how factors such as staff count, location, and other variables impact sales performance. By analysing this data, marketing professionals can make more informed decisions about whether a particular location needs to hire more staff to meet sales demands. They can also identify opportunities to attract more customers by creating targeted offers or promotions for specific products, optimising resources and maximising sales potential. This approach helps ensure that the marketing strategies are aligned with business objectives and customer needs.\n",

    "The company and consumers/customers\n",
    "#### **Use:**\n",
    "People in marketing will greatly benefit from this data, as it allows them to make well-informed decisions. By analysing the data, they can find trends and preferences, allowing them to make promotions and marketing strategies more effectively. This then not only boosts the success of their company but also ensures that customers receive more relevant and appealing offers, making customers more happy (or alternatively raising the prices so that no one is happy).\n",

The location of the store (state) was found to not have much of an impact, this is expected as the data was restricted to only providing states and not more precise locations. Customers of course had a huge impact as they are of course the consumers and the actual people buying and providing the compant with money."
